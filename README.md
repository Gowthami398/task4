└── task3_password_generator.py
📋 Instructions for GitHub:
Create a new GitHub repository:
Go to GitHub.com
Click "New repository"
Name it task3 or password-generator-app
Make it public
Don't initialize with README (we'll add our own)
Add the Python file:
Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
Name it task3_password_generator.py
Copy and paste the Python code above
Click "Commit new file"
Add the README:
Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
Name it README.md
Copy and paste the README code above
Click "Commit new file"
Get your GitHub link:
Your repository URL will be: https://github.com/Gowthami398/task3
Copy this link for the main README update
Test the application:
Clone your repository locally
Install pyperclip: pip install pyperclip
Run python task3_password_generator.py
The password generator should work perfectly!
Once you've created the task3 repository, let me know the GitHub link and I'll update your main README file with it! 🎉
